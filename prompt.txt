I want to create a React JS App that uses the speaker to ask questions derived from a PDF I have. I want to use OpenAI's API to provide all of the backend. I have prepared an agent that asks questions and one that parses the answers. You will design the front end in React JS using a modern, but inviting style with attention to detail and color choice. Any questions?
